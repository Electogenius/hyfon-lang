# hyfon-lang
Repo for hyfon, an unusual programming language 

# How to use:

Add this to your code:
```HTML
<script src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/Electogenius/hyfon-lang/main/Hyfon.js"></script>
```
And to run the hyfon code in a string, run (in a js script):
```JavaScript
hyfon_string('insert code here!', 'insert where the output will be sent to (what part of the document counts as "sys")');
//or if you are using an external file (extension: .-):
hyfon_run_filename("filename without extension", "where is 'sys'");
```
and btw not much works rn
